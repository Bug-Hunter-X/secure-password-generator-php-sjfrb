This code uses a weak random number generator for passwords.  It's vulnerable to predictability, which compromises security. 
```php
<?php
function generatePassword() {
  return substr(str_shuffle('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'), 0, 8);
}
$password = generatePassword();
echo "Generated Password: " . $password;
?>
```
